This code is an attempt of trying to build a machine learning model.
The story is I built this simple model using maths concepts my ML professor taught us.
This model is a simple linear regression model, that use gradient decent to predict values. 
The code is not any where near optimized computer program, i know it. 
Code takes three inputs. Series of x values and y values, more like training data set in usual ML models. And the alpha value.

-----------
I made an library out of it. 

eg:- piLib.datain() to start execution
